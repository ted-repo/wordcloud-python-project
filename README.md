# Wordcloud Project from Cousera crash course on Python.


This repository contains my solution code to the final project of this course on "word cloud".

A word cloud is an image that's made up of different sized words. Usually the sizes of the words are determined by how many times each word appears in a specific text.



## Project goal
Create a dictionary with words and word frequencies that can be passed to the generate_from_frequencies function of the WordCloud class using the Jupyter notebook provided from within the course.



###### Things to remember
- Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks.
- Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting" set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if").
